As the number of data points and features increase, the required calculations increases exponentially! As such, KNN is extremely resource intensive for large datasets.\n", "\n", "## Distance metrics\n", "\n", "You learned about Minkowski distance and two cases of Minkowski distance: Euclidean and Manhattan distance. Other distance metrics such as Hamming distance can even be used to compare strings! (Hamming distance can be used to offer typo correction-suggestions for instance by comparing similar words generated by changing only one or two letters from the mistyped word). \n", "\n", "## Model tuning in scikit-learn \n", "\n", "Remember that model tuning encapsulates the entire gamut of the data science process from problem formulation and preprocessing through hyperparameter tuning. Furthermore, you also need to choose a validation method to determine the model's ability to generalize to new cases such as train-test split or cross-validation. Good models require careful thought, ample preprocessing, and exploration followed by hyperparameter tuning."]}, {"cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {}, "source": ["## Summary\n", "\n", "Well done!
